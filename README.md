### Vim With Me
Chat, by spending channel points, can execute some set of commands on my system.

* Execute Vim commands.
  - navigational, delete, yoink, paste

* Make my keyboard go qwerty for a period of time.
  - Seems reasonable

* i3 commands
  - move windows, move focus, full screen, dock, resize, ...

### Why C?
Because I wanted to feel the pain of real development, not a language developed
and powered by unicorn poop.
